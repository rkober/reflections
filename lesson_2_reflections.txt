What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates the meta data for tracking and commiting the files in the directory to a new respository.
Without this information git doesn't realize that you have a new repsoitory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area allows you to group your files into smaller peices to be committed together without commiting everything
at once.  This allows you to init a repository after a few changes have been made, but still allows you to create logical
groupings of commits, instead of bundling everything together into a single mass commit.
