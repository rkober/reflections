When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing content across computers, when wanting to publish content to a wider audience, 
when wanting to backup content to more than a single drive, and when looking to work on content with other parties.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may be working on a specific feature that you aren't ready to merge with the public repository yet.  It's also likely that you will
want to work offline.  Plus you don't want changes to the public respository to interfere with you while you are making your own changes.
